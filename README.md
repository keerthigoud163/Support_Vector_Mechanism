# Support_Vector_Mechanism

# Project Title :
Using the Support Vector Mechanism Algorithm of supervised machine learning predict iris.csv datasets to find out species will be same.

# Problem Statement:
A American waist botnical garden grow iris flower in their labs but using bio technology in a single tree different types of variety flower is grow. As a Data Science Engineer find out how much accuracy is their all categories contains same species.

# Task 1:
Preprocess the data in skit.learn library.
# Task 2:
Load the data using sklearn model selection defaukt argument.
# Task 3:
On the basis of your dataset train,test and split SVM model.
# Task 4:
Implement the Support Vector Mechanism Classifier using svm_classifier. the svm must be "Linear".
# Task 5:
Train the classifier on the training data.
# Task 6:
Find out the prediction value on the test data
# Task 7:
Test the model with the help of accuracy ,accuracy should be lie in the range 0-1

# Accuracy

# Conclusion :
According to my support vector mechanism model the species or linear. With the accuracy of 1.00.
Hence proved model was successfully implement
